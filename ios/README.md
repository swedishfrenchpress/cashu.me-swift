# Cashu Wallet iOS

A privacy-first iOS wallet for Cashu ecash and the Lightning Network, with on-chain Bitcoin support and NFC contactless payments.

Built with SwiftUI, targets iOS 18+, and uses [cdk-swift](https://github.com/asmogo/cdk-swift) (the Cashu Dev Kit) under the hood.

## Features

- **Ecash** — mint, send, and redeem Cashu tokens across multiple mints
- **Lightning** — pay and receive BOLT11 invoices, with Lightning Address support
- **On-chain** — send to and receive from regular Bitcoin addresses
- **Contactless (NFC)** — tap-to-pay using NDEF tags
- **Nostr** — NWC (Nostr Wallet Connect), payment requests, and NPC integration
- **P2PK** locking, multi-mint discovery, and deterministic recovery from seed
- Backup & restore from BIP-39 seed phrase

## Building

Open `ios/CashuWallet.xcodeproj` from the repository root, or open
`CashuWallet.xcodeproj` from this folder, in Xcode 16+ and run on an iOS 18
simulator or device. Swift Package Manager resolves `cdk-swift` automatically.

For a CLI build to the simulator from this folder:

```sh
xcodebuild -project CashuWallet.xcodeproj \
  -scheme CashuWallet \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  build
```

## Project layout

- `CashuWallet/App` — app entry point and root view
- `CashuWallet/Core` — services (wallet, mints, NFC, Nostr, keychain), navigation, settings
- `CashuWallet/Views` — SwiftUI views grouped by flow (Send, Receive, Mints, History, Settings)
- `CashuWallet/Models` — data types and protocols
