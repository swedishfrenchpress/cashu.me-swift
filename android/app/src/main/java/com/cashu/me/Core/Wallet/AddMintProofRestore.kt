/**
 * NUT-09 proof recovery that must run as part of [WalletManager.addMint].
 *
 * Seed restore alone does not recover balance — proofs live at the mint and
 * only reappear after `wallet.restore()`. Users often restore a seed (e.g.
 * from cashu.me) then add the mint from Mints instead of the restore-mints
 * wizard; without this step the home balance stays 0 forever even though the
 * seed is correct.
 *
 * The caller runs this after persisting the mint so adding stays responsive;
 * failures still propagate to that background task for reporting. Brand-new
 * wallets get an empty restore (fast no-op).
