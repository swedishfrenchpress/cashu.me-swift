# Cashu Wallet — Android UX Spec

This document is the **behavior contract** the Android rebuild must match. It describes *what the iOS app does and shows*, not *how SwiftUI builds it*. Android implements it with idiomatic Material 3.

When this spec and Material 3 disagree on the **idiom**, Material 3 wins (see `UX_MAPPING.md` for divergences). When they disagree on **information architecture or available actions**, this spec wins — the two apps must feel like the same product.

---

## 0. Product identity

Cashu Wallet is a **system utility**, not a crypto dashboard. The bar is set by Apple Wallet, Notes, Find My — and on Android, by Google Wallet, Messages, and Maps' top-app-bar utilities. Quiet, precise, native.

**Rejected:** confetti, achievement badges, "earned"/"streak" language, neon-on-black, signature gradients, hero-metric SaaS panels, mascots, NFT-style portfolio analytics, illustrated empty states.

**Prioritized:** restraint and clarity; native materials and motion; numbers given the care of a stopwatch; semantic-only color; one strong action per surface; readable by a phone-illiterate user.

### Named rules carried over from iOS DESIGN.md

| Rule | Meaning on Android |
|------|---------|
| **Semantic-Only Rule** | Use M3 `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.*` slots only. Three state hues are the *only* custom colors: `received-green` (#34C759), `pending-orange` (#FF9500), `error-red` (#FF3B30 / M3 `error`). |
| **One Green Rule** | Green appears only on **completed incoming** amounts and the incoming directional badge. Outgoing amounts use `onSurface`. Pending amounts use `onSurfaceVariant`. |
| **Quiet Pending Rule** | Pending state = clock icon + low-alpha orange tint, never a saturated pill. |
| **Tabular Figure Rule** | All balances/amounts/fees use a monospaced-digit `FontFeatureSetting` and animate digits independently (`Modifier.animateContentSize` + `AnimatedContent` with `numericContentTransform`). |
| **System-Style Rule** | All text uses `MaterialTheme.typography.*` slots so it scales with system font size. No hardcoded `sp` outside the theme file. |
| **Flat-By-Default Rule** | No elevation on rows, cards, buttons. Depth from M3 tonal surfaces and 0.5dp dividers only. **One exception:** transient success toast (a floating M3 surface). |
| **CanvasDivider Rule** | List rows on canvas screens are separated by a single 0.5dp `HorizontalDivider` with 28dp leading inset — never card stacks. |
| **Share-At-Top Rule** | When a screen shows a shareable QR (invoice, request, token, transaction), `Share` lives in the `TopAppBar` actions, never in the footer button stack. |
| **Singular Button Rule** | Primary AND secondary CTAs both use `FilledTonalButton`. No `OutlinedButton`, no inverted-fill. Hierarchy via copy and disabled state. The single most-prominent action per screen (e.g. "Create Wallet") may use `Button` (filled). |
| **Iconless-CTA Rule** | Primary CTAs (Copy, Send, Receive, Continue, New Request) are text-only. No leading icons. |

---

## 1. Shell

**Bottom navigation: 4 tabs.**

| # | Tab | Icon (Material) | Destination |
|---|-----|------|--------|
| 1 | **Wallet** | `Icons.Outlined.AccountBalanceWallet` (selected: `Icons.Filled.AccountBalanceWallet`) | Home screen |
| 2 | **History** | `Icons.Outlined.History` / `Icons.Filled.History` | Activity timeline |
| 3 | **Mints** | `Icons.Outlined.AccountBalance` / `Icons.Filled.AccountBalance` | Mint list |
| 4 | **Settings** | `Icons.Outlined.Settings` / `Icons.Filled.Settings` | Settings root |

Send and Receive are **not tabs**. They are the two primary action buttons on the Wallet screen (alongside Scan), each opening a `ModalBottomSheet` chooser (Ecash / Bitcoin / Contactless).

**Gating states** (resolved by `WalletManager.state`):
- `!isInitialized` → centered `CircularProgressIndicator` (full screen, no chrome).
- `needsOnboarding` → full-screen `OnboardingScreen` (no bottom nav).
- Otherwise → `WalletScaffold` with `NavigationBar`.

**Deep links** (existing `NavigationManager.pendingDeepLink`):
- `cashu:` URL → push `ReceiveTokenDetailScreen` over the current tab.
- BOLT11/BOLT12/onchain URI → switch to Wallet tab, open Send flow with prefilled payload.
- Mint URL (`https://...`) → switch to Mints tab, prefill add-mint form.

---

## 2. Onboarding

A multi-step host displaying one step at a time with horizontal slide-through-fade transitions. No bottom nav. No `TopAppBar` except where noted.

| Step | Purpose | Primary actions | Key elements |
|------|---------|------------------|---------------|
| **Welcome** | First-launch landing | "Create Wallet" (filled `Button`), "I have a seed phrase" (`TextButton`), "What is ecash?" (opens info sheet) | Centered hero: small caption "CASHU" (letter-spaced), title "Private cash. In your pocket." |
| **Show mnemonic** | Display generated 12-word seed | "Copy & Back Up" (`FilledTonalButton`), "Continue" | 12 numbered words in a 2-column grid. Long-press to copy whole phrase. Warning supporting text: "Anyone with these words can spend your wallet." |
| **Verify mnemonic** | Quiz user on 3 random positions | "Verify" (disabled until all 3 filled) | Three `OutlinedTextField`s labeled by word position ("Word 4", "Word 8", "Word 11"). Error supporting text on mismatch. |
| **First mint** | Pick the wallet's first mint | "Continue" (disabled until selection) | Recommended mints as selectable cards (radio-style). Or "Use custom mint URL" expands an `OutlinedTextField`. |
| **Restore input** | Paste seed for restore path | "Restore" (disabled until 12 valid BIP39 words) | Multi-line `OutlinedTextField` for seed phrase. Inline word-count chip ("11 / 12"). |
| **Restore mints** | Show discovered mints from seed | "Restore selected" + "Skip for now" | List of mints found via NIP-60 discovery; each has a "Restore" `FilledTonalButton`. Shows balance found per mint as it loads. |

Information sheet "What is ecash?" — a `ModalBottomSheet` with two paragraphs and a "Got it" button.

**Done state** triggers `walletManager.completeOnboarding()` → app re-evaluates the gate and renders `WalletScaffold`.

---

## 3. Wallet (Home)

**Layout — pinned top, scrolling body.** Use a `Scaffold` with a top-aligned non-scrolling section and a `LazyColumn` body. The body fades into the pinned section via a vertical gradient mask at the top (already implemented on iOS Home; preserve).

### 3.1 Pinned top (fixed)

Top-to-bottom inside the pinned region:

1. **Mint chip** — `AssistChip` with active mint name. Tap opens `DropdownMenu` listing all mints (checkmark on active) + "Change mint…" item that opens a `ModalBottomSheet` mint picker.
2. **Balance** — `displayLarge` or larger, bold, monospaced digits. Tappable to toggle ₿ vs sat unit (persists in `SettingsManager.useBitcoinSymbol`). Animates digit-by-digit on change.
3. **Fiat sub-line** — only if `settings.showFiatBalance && priceService.btcPriceUsd > 0`. `titleMedium`, `onSurfaceVariant`, monospaced digits. Silently updates on price ticks (no animation).
4. **Action row.** Carve-out from the original "triptych" spec: the current build matches iOS by placing **Receive** and **Send** as two equal-width `FilledTonalButton`s, with **Scan** living as a separate `FilledTonalIconButton` (M3 default size) in the top-right corner of the pinned region. Button height is 56dp (M3 standard CTA height). Tap Receive/Send → bottom-sheet chooser; tap Scan → full-screen `ScannerScreen`.

`TopAppBar` is empty / hidden on Home (the pinned region serves the role).

### 3.2 Scrolling body

- **Notification toast** (top inset) — if `walletManager.lastNotification` non-null. Floating M3 surface with leading icon, message, and dismiss `IconButton`. Auto-dismiss after 5s. Toast carries the only allowed shadow in the app.
- **"Recent activity" section header** — `labelMedium`, uppercase, letter-spaced, `onSurfaceVariant`. **Padding: 16dp top, 8dp bottom** (carve-out from the original 28dp top spec — matches iOS rhythm where `HistoryView` and `SettingsView` section headers both use 16pt top). Rendered via the shared `SectionHeader` component for consistency across Home, History, Settings, and Mints.
- **Up to 5 transaction rows** — same anatomy as History rows (see §4.2). `CanvasDivider` between, none after last.
- **"View all activity" `TextButton`** — bottom of section, navigates to History tab.

**Empty state**: if no mints, replace the activity section with `EmptyState(icon = Icons.Outlined.AccountBalance, title = "Add a mint to get started", supporting = "Mints custody your ecash. Go to the Mints tab to add one.", actionLabel = "Add mint", onAction = …)`. If mints exist but no transactions, show `EmptyState(icon = Icons.Outlined.History, title = "No transactions yet", supporting = "Your activity will show up here.")`.

### 3.3 Receive chooser sheet

`ModalBottomSheet`, `skipPartiallyExpanded = true`, height wraps content. Options as a vertical `Column` of M3 `ListItem`s with **cascade-in animation** (each item: 0.07s stagger, 12dp horizontal slide-in, fade). Tap an option → dismiss the chooser → open the relevant flow sheet.

| Label | Leading icon | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Ecash** | `Icons.Outlined.Money` (banknote) | Open `ReceiveEcashScreen` flow sheet (wrap-content ≈ iOS `.medium`) |
| **Bitcoin** | `Icons.Outlined.CurrencyBitcoin` | Open `ReceiveLightningScreen` flow sheet (full height) |

> **Revised 2026-07:** the money flows (Send, Send Ecash, Receive Ecash, Receive Lightning) are presented as native M3 modal bottom sheets via `ui.shell.WalletFlowSheetHost`, not pushed destinations — restoring iOS sheet parity. Each screen renders a `SheetHeader` (close/back + title + actions) instead of a `TopAppBar`. Dismissal is blocked while money is in flight.

### 3.4 Send chooser sheet

Same anatomy as Receive chooser. Cascade-in.

| Label | Leading icon | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Ecash** | `Icons.Outlined.Money` | Push `SendEcashScreen` |
| **Bitcoin** | `Icons.Outlined.CurrencyBitcoin` | Push `SendLightningScreen` |
| **Contactless** *(only if device has NFC)* | `Icons.Outlined.Nfc` | Push `ContactlessScreen` |

### 3.5 Scanner

Full-screen destination (route `scanner/{target}`). Pure black background, camera preview, white viewfinder cutout, top `IconButton` close (×). On successful scan, dismiss and route per payload type (see Shell deep-link rules). Keep current ML Kit barcode implementation; only re-chrome.

---

## 4. History

Pushed top-level destination from the History tab. `CenterAlignedTopAppBar(title = "History")` (carve-out from the original `LargeTopAppBar` spec — the three top-level destinations Home, History, Mints, Settings all use the compact `CenterAlignedTopAppBar` for a uniformly dense feel that matches iOS inline titles). Hides on scroll via `exitUntilCollapsedScrollBehavior`. Trailing actions: filter `IconButton` + search `IconButton` (opens M3 `SearchBar`).

### 4.1 Filter & search

- **Filter menu** — `IconButton(Icons.Outlined.FilterList)` opens `DropdownMenu` with single-select: All transactions / Pending only / Completed only. Filter icon switches to filled variant when any non-default filter is active. Selection emits haptic feedback.
- **Search** — entering search collapses `LargeTopAppBar` to a full-width `SearchBar`. Matches by description (transaction kind/type) and amount substring. Resets pagination on every keystroke.

### 4.2 Timeline

`LazyColumn`. Items are a unified `HistoryItem` (transaction or Cashu Request), sorted by date descending, grouped into date buckets.

**Section header** (date bucket): `labelMedium`, uppercase, letter-spaced, `onSurfaceVariant`. Examples: "TODAY", "YESTERDAY", "THIS WEEK", "JUNE 2026".

**Row anatomy:**

| Slot | Contents |
|------|---------|
| Leading (40dp) | Method icon (Ecash custom glyph / `Icons.Filled.Bolt` for Lightning / `Icons.Outlined.CurrencyBitcoin` for on-chain) **with a bottom-trailing 16dp status badge** on a `surface`-colored circle. Badge swaps via `AnimatedContent` w/ fade-through (~280ms). |
| Title (top) | `bodyLarge`, e.g. "Lightning received", "Bitcoin sent", "Sent ecash". |
| Subtitle (bottom) | `bodySmall`, `onSurfaceVariant`, relative timestamp ("2 hr ago"). |
| Trailing top | Amount: `bodyLarge` semibold, monospaced digits, prefix `+`/`−`. Color rules below. |
| Trailing bottom | Fiat sub-amount: `bodySmall`, `onSurfaceVariant`, monospaced. Only if `showFiatBalance && btcPriceUsd > 0`. |

**Status badge colors:**
- Pending: `Icons.Outlined.Schedule` (clock), `pending-orange`, pulsing alpha animation.
- Completed incoming: `Icons.Filled.ArrowDownward`, `received-green`.
- Completed outgoing: `Icons.Filled.ArrowUpward`, `onSurface`.

**Amount color:**
- Pending: `onSurfaceVariant`.
- Completed: `received-green` (both directions — "money landed is money landed", per iOS).
- Failed: `onSurface`.

**Divider:** `HorizontalDivider(thickness = 0.5.dp, color = outlineVariant)`, 28dp leading inset. None after the last row in a section.

**Entrance:** first 8 rows on initial render animate in with 35ms stagger, 6dp y-offset → 0, fade in. Subsequent loads/filters re-render snappily without stagger.

**Pagination:** initial 30 items; load 30 more when within 5 items of the bottom.

**Long-press menu (Cashu Request rows only):** opens `DropdownMenu` with "Remove from history" (destructive). Tap → `AlertDialog` confirm → `CashuRequestStore.delete(id)`.

**Tap targets:**
- Transaction row → push `TransactionDetailScreen` (route argument: transaction ID).
- Cashu Request row → push `CashuRequestDetailScreen` (route argument: request ID).

### 4.3 Empty states

- No transactions and no filter applied: `EmptyState(icon = Icons.Outlined.Bolt, title = "No transactions yet", supporting = "Your transaction history will appear here.")`.
- Filtered (e.g. "Pending only") and result is empty: `EmptyState(icon = Icons.Outlined.Schedule, title = "No pending transactions")`.

---

## 5. Mints

Pushed top-level destination from the Mints tab. `CenterAlignedTopAppBar(title = "Mints")` (compact — see §4 for the cross-tab carve-out from the original Large variant).

### 5.1 List

`LazyColumn` with:
1. **Mints section** — each mint as a row (see anatomy below).
2. **"Discover mints"** `ListItem` with leading `Icons.Outlined.Search` → pushes `MintDiscoveryScreen`.
3. **Add mint inline form** — two `OutlinedTextField`s (URL, optional nickname) + `TextButton("Paste URL from clipboard")` + `FilledTonalButton("Add")` (disabled until URL non-empty and adding-in-progress is false).
4. **Inline error** below the Add button on failure: `bodyMedium`, `error` color.

**Mint row anatomy:**

| Slot | Contents |
|------|---------|
| Leading (40dp) | `AsyncImage` of `mint.iconUrl` if present, else a colored circle (deterministic by mint URL hash) with mint's first letter. Bottom-trailing **green dot** if this is the active mint. |
| Title | `bodyLarge`, mint nickname or domain. |
| Subtitle | `bodySmall`, `onSurfaceVariant`, mint URL middle-truncated. |
| Below subtitle | Row of method `AssistChip`s (very small): "Lightning" / "Bitcoin" / "Ecash". Tonal chip color hints at method (yellow/orange/blue), low-saturation. |
| Trailing | None for plain navigation rows (whole row is the tap target). |

Tap row → push `MintDetailScreen(url)`.

### 5.2 Mint Detail

Pushed route. `LargeTopAppBar(title = mint.name)`. Loads `MintInfo` asynchronously; shows `LinearProgressIndicator` at the top edge while loading.

`LazyColumn` of sections, each as a `Card`-less group with `SectionHeader` and `ListItem` children (use `CanvasDivider` inside groups):

| Section | Rows |
|---------|------|
| **Header** | Large icon (72dp) + name + URL (copyable on tap, `Icons.Outlined.ContentCopy` trailing). Pubkey as monospaced `bodySmall`, copyable. |
| **About** | Mint description (multi-paragraph). |
| **Message of the day** | If present. |
| **Contact** | Email / Twitter / etc. — each row tappable to open external app. |
| **Software** | Name, version. |
| **Payment methods** | Per-method: name + min/max amounts + fees. |
| **Supported NUTs** | Comma-separated NUT numbers, monospaced. |
| **Wallet** | Balance on this mint, monospaced. |
| **Terms of Service** | Link row → opens browser. |
| **Actions** | `TextButton("Remove Mint", colors = ButtonDefaults.textButtonColors(contentColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.error))`. Tap → `AlertDialog` "Remove mint?" / "Cancel" / "Remove". |

### 5.3 Discover Mints

Pushed route (not a sheet — it's a search list). `LargeTopAppBar(title = "Discover")` + M3 `SearchBar` below. List shows curated/recommended mints from `MintDiscoveryManager`. Each row: name, description, method chips, and trailing `FilledTonalButton("Add")` (changes to "Added" check on success).

---

## 6. Settings

Pushed top-level destination from the Settings tab. `CenterAlignedTopAppBar(title = "Settings")` (compact — see §4 for the cross-tab carve-out from the original Large variant).

`LazyColumn` of section groups. Each group:
- Group header — `labelMedium`, uppercase, letter-spaced, `onSurfaceVariant`, 24dp top, 8dp bottom.
- Group body — rows as M3 `ListItem` with trailing `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.KeyboardArrowRight`. `CanvasDivider` between rows.

| Section | Rows | Pushed destination |
|---------|------|--------------------|
| **Backup** | Backup & Restore | `BackupScreen` |
| **Payments** | Lightning, P2PK | `LightningScreen`, `P2PKScreen` |
| **Integrations** | Nostr, Nostr Wallet Connect | `NostrScreen`, `NWCScreen` |
| **Privacy & Display** | Privacy, Appearance | `PrivacyScreen`, `AppearanceScreen` |
| **About** | "Learn about Cashu", "Protocol Specs (NUTs)" | External browser intents |
| **Danger** | "Delete Wallet" (`error` color text) | Triggers `AlertDialog` |

Footer below all groups: app name + version, `bodySmall`, centered, `onSurfaceVariant`.

### 6.1 Sub-screens

| Screen | Contents |
|--------|---------|
| **BackupScreen** | Seed display (12 words, numbered 2-column grid, long-press to copy phrase). `FilledTonalButton("Copy phrase")`, `FilledTonalButton("Verify phrase")` (toggles to the verify quiz inline), `TextButton("Restore from seed")`. |
| **LightningScreen** | Lightning address row (configured value or "Set up Lightning address" CTA). Tap → push setup sub-screen with username `OutlinedTextField` + domain dropdown + save. |
| **P2PKScreen** | List of pubkeys (monospaced, middle-truncated, copy + delete trailing icons). `FilledTonalButton("Generate key")`, `FilledTonalButton("Import key")`. |
| **NostrScreen** | Nsec masked display + reveal `IconButton(Icons.Outlined.Visibility)`. Import nsec button (opens dialog). Relay list with add/remove. |
| **NWCScreen** | Connection list. Each row: connection nickname, copy connection string, revoke action. "Generate connection string" `FilledTonalButton`. |
| **PrivacyScreen** | M3 `Switch` rows: "Show balance on lock screen", "Hide transaction amounts", etc. |
| **AppearanceScreen** | Theme `SegmentedButtonRow` (Light / Dark / System). `Switch` rows: "Show fiat balance", "Use ₿ symbol". |

### 6.2 Delete Wallet

`AlertDialog` triggered by Danger row.
- Title: "Delete Wallet"
- Body: "Are you sure? This action cannot be undone. Back up your seed phrase first."
- Cancel `TextButton` + "Delete" `TextButton(colors = … error)`.
- Confirm → `walletManager.deleteWallet()` → app re-evaluates the gate (returns to Onboarding).

---

## 7. Send flows

Full-height `ModalBottomSheet` flows hosted by `ui.shell.WalletFlowSheetHost` (**revised 2026-07** — previously pushed destinations; converted for iOS `.large`-sheet parity). Each is a single screen with **two faces** swapped via `AnimatedContent` (250ms fade-through cross-fade), headed by a `SheetHeader` instead of a `TopAppBar`. Sheet dismissal (swipe/scrim/back) is blocked while a payment or token generation is in flight; system back unwinds faces before the sheet closes.

### 7.1 Send Ecash

**Face A — Input.** `TopAppBar(title = "Send ecash", navigationIcon = Close)`.

Body, top-to-bottom:
1. **Mint selector** — `AssistChip` with active mint. Tap → `ModalBottomSheet` mint picker.
2. **Amount display** — large, centered, monospaced. Tappable to switch sats ↔ fiat as the primary unit.
3. **Optional memo** — `OutlinedTextField`, single line, label "Memo (optional)".
4. **P2PK lock toggle** — `IconButton(Icons.Outlined.Lock)` in `TopAppBar` trailing. Expanded state reveals an `OutlinedTextField` for recipient pubkey.
5. **Error supporting text** — `error` color, slide-in/out.
6. **Number pad** — custom `NumberPadAmountInput` (already exists in `Views/Send/Components/`). Keep that logic; re-skin to use M3 tokens.
7. **Send `FilledTonalButton`** — bottom-pinned, full width, disabled if amount is 0.

On tap Send: per iOS DESIGN.md and the memory file *No Send-confirm gate* — **fire immediately**, no confirm modal. Loading spinner replaces button text. On success, face swaps to B.

**Face B — Token display.** `TopAppBar(title = "Pending ecash", navigationIcon = Close, actions = [Share])`.

Body:
1. **QR card** — white-on-surface card, rounded 20dp, 16dp padding, `QRCodeView` 280dp. Long-press → context dropdown menu (Copy, Share).
2. **Amount** — large, centered, monospaced, `onSurfaceVariant`.
3. **Memo** if present, `bodyMedium`, centered.
4. **Status row** — "Waiting for recipient" with subtle pulsing dot. When poll detects claim, swap to "Token claimed" with `received-green` `Icons.Filled.CheckCircle` and bounce-in animation, hold 2.5s, then offer a "Send another" `FilledTonalButton`.
5. **Copy `FilledTonalButton`** — full width. Tap → copies token, label becomes "Copied" for 2s.

### 7.2 Send Lightning

Same two-face shape. Input face accepts: invoice (BOLT11), offer (BOLT12), Lightning address, on-chain address — parsed by existing `PaymentRequestDecoder`.

Input face:
- **Mint selector** chip.
- **Decoded payload card** — shows destination type, amount (if known), description, expiry.
- **Amount entry** if the request is amountless.
- **Pay `FilledTonalButton`** — disabled until valid; fires immediately on tap.

Display face: spinner during payment, then success or failure card with preimage / failure reason. Share action in `TopAppBar` for the preimage / txid.

### 7.3 Contactless

Pushed full-screen destination. Pure NFC reader UI: animated wave icon, "Hold device near recipient", `IconButton(Icons.Outlined.Close)` to cancel. On read, parse payload and route to the appropriate send flow with prefill.

---

## 8. Receive flows

Same two-face pattern as Send. Receive Ecash is a **wrap-content** flow sheet (≈ iOS `.medium` detent); Receive Lightning is full height (**revised 2026-07** — previously pushed destinations).

### 8.1 Receive Ecash

**Face A — Input.** `SheetHeader(title = "Receive ecash", navigationIcon = Close, actions = [Scan])`.

Body:
1. **Token field** — `CashuTextField`, multi-line (6–8 lines, scrolls internally), monospaced, placeholder "cashuB…". The paste (`Icons.Outlined.ContentPaste`) / clear (`Icons.Filled.Cancel`) affordance is **overlaid at the field's bottom-trailing corner** (iOS parity) — never in the vertically-centered trailing slot.
2. **Error inline notice** if validation fails.
3. **Continue** — `PrimaryButton`, disabled when empty. On tap: validate via `TokenParser`. If valid, swap to face B (token detail). If valid but P2PK-locked to a key the wallet doesn't have, show inline error and disable Continue.
4. **New Request** — `SecondaryButton` (tonal; one step quieter than Continue).

**Face B — Token detail** (the *Receive Token Detail* face).
- Amount (large, centered).
- Inspector rows: Fee (with loading spinner while computing), Mint (truncated), P2PK status (e.g. "Locked to your key").
- "Receive" `FilledTonalButton` — fires immediately, no confirm. On success: success toast, dismiss back to caller.
- "Receive later" `TextButton` — saves to `PendingReceiveTokens`; row appears in History.

**Alternative Face A flow:** "Create Cashu Request" `TextButton` at the bottom of face A. Tap → pushes `CashuRequestDetailScreen` (a fresh request).

### 8.2 Receive Lightning

`TopAppBar(title = "Receive Bitcoin", navigationIcon = Close)`.

**Face A — Input:**
- **Mint selector** chip.
- **Method `SegmentedButtonRow`** — BOLT11 / BOLT12 / On-chain (only methods the active mint supports).
- **Amount entry** (centered large display + number pad), or "Amountless" toggle for BOLT12.
- **"Create request" `FilledTonalButton`** — disabled until valid.

**Face B — Display:**
- QR card.
- Amount (if specified).
- Status block: "Waiting for payment…" with pulsing clock; on payment received, swap to "Payment received!" with bounce `Icons.Filled.CheckCircle` (`received-green`), hold 2.5s, then settle to persistent "N payments received".
- Expiry timer if applicable ("Expires in 14m 32s").
- **Copy `FilledTonalButton`** — copies invoice/address.
- **Share** in `TopAppBar` trailing.

Polling cadence and celebration sequence match iOS exactly.

### 8.3 Cashu Request Detail

Pushed route (or rendered as Face B of Receive Ecash). `TopAppBar(title = "Cashu Request", actions = [Share])`.

Body:
- QR card.
- Amount (if fixed; otherwise hidden).
- Status: same waiting / live-burst / persistent count states as Receive Lightning.
- **Inspector rows** — `ListItem`s with leading icon, label, trailing value, and (on editable rows) a trailing pencil `IconButton`. Inspector divider is 0.5dp at 8dp horizontal inset (tighter than canvas).

| Row | Editable | Tap behavior |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| Mint | Yes | Opens `ModalBottomSheet` mint picker; on select, regenerates request. |
| Amount | Yes | Opens `ModalBottomSheet` with number pad; on confirm, regenerates request. |
| Unit | No | — |
| Created | No | — |

- **Copy `FilledTonalButton`** — copies encoded request.
- **New Request `TextButton`** — regenerates from scratch.

### 8.4 Receive Token Detail (deep-link entry)

When a `cashu:` deep link arrives, push this screen over whatever tab is active. Same shape as Receive Ecash Face B. Has its own `TopAppBar(title = "Receive Ecash", navigationIcon = Close)`. On Receive, dismiss to the previous tab. On Receive Later, save and dismiss.

---

## 9. Transaction detail

Pushed route from History (or from Home recent activity). `TopAppBar(title = "", navigationIcon = Close, actions = [Share if shareable])`.

Body, top-to-bottom:
1. **QR card** if the transaction has a shareable payload (token / invoice / address); else a large centered method icon with status badge.
2. **Amount** (large, monospaced, colored per status rules).
3. **Status row** — same icons + colors as History row.
4. **Inspector rows**: Type, Fee, Unit, State, Mint, Request (truncated, monospaced), Proof / preimage / txid (truncated, monospaced).
5. **External link row** — "View in block explorer" for on-chain.
6. **Copy `FilledTonalButton`** if there is a copyable payload (footer).

Long-press on QR opens `DropdownMenu` (Copy, Share).

---

## 10. Cross-cutting

### 10.1 Buttons

| Use | Component |
|-----|---------|
| Primary CTA | `FilledTonalButton`, full width, 56dp min height, body weight semibold, text-only. |
| Secondary CTA | `FilledTonalButton` (same — Singular Button Rule). |
| The single most-prominent action on Onboarding | `Button` (filled). |
| Inline action (Copy, Paste) | `TextButton`. |
| Icon-only | `IconButton`. |
| Destructive | `TextButton` with `contentColor = error`. |

Pressed state: native M3 ripple. Disabled state: M3 default (opacity reduction). Haptic feedback on press for primary actions (`HapticFeedbackType.LongPress` or the existing `HapticFeedback` utility).

### 10.2 Bottom sheets

`ModalBottomSheet` with `skipPartiallyExpanded = true` (matches iOS fixed-detent feel). Drag indicator visible. Background scrim. Sheets used:

| Sheet | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Receive chooser | 2–3 list items, cascade-in. |
| Send chooser | 2–3 list items, cascade-in. |
| Mint picker | List of mints, single-select. |
| Amount picker (for Cashu Request edit) | Number pad. |
| QR detail (NWC, Nostr) | QR card + copy/share. |

Avoid nesting bottom sheets on top of bottom sheets when avoidable. iOS does this for sub-pickers from Cashu Request Detail; on Android, the parent here is a *pushed screen*, so the picker can be a bottom sheet over it without nesting.

### 10.3 Dialogs

`AlertDialog` for confirmations (delete mint, delete wallet, remove Cashu Request) and one-decision alerts. Title + body + Cancel / destructive action.

### 10.4 Toasts and banners

- **Success notification** (token received) → floating M3 surface at top, slides down from above, 5s auto-dismiss, dismissible. Shadow allowed (sole exception to flat rule).
- **Inline error** → `error`-colored supporting text below the offending field. No global error toast.
- **Network errors** → red banner with retry button at the top of the affected screen.

### 10.5 Empty states

`EmptyState` composable with: `Icon` (32–48dp, `onSurfaceVariant`), title (`titleMedium`), supporting (`bodyMedium`, `onSurfaceVariant`), optional CTA (`FilledTonalButton`). Centered vertically when alone on a screen; left-aligned when it shares space.

### 10.6 Loading

- Full screen → centered `CircularProgressIndicator`.
- Top of screen, async → `LinearProgressIndicator` at the very top edge.
- Inline (button) → swap label with small `CircularProgressIndicator` (16dp).

### 10.7 Motion

Match iOS named animations as closely as Compose allows.

| iOS animation | Compose recipe |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Row stagger | `LazyColumn` items use `animateItemPlacement()` + `AnimatedVisibility` with 35ms-per-index `enterDelay`, capped at 8. |
| Badge symbol-replace | `AnimatedContent(targetState = badgeState, transitionSpec = { fadeIn(tween(280)) togetherWith fadeOut(tween(280)) })`. |
| Chooser cascade | `AnimatedVisibility` per item, 70ms-per-index delay, slide-in horizontally (12dp) + fade. |
| Press feedback | M3 native ripple + scale-on-press via `Modifier.scale()` keyed to `interactionSource.collectIsPressedAsState()`. |
| Sheet cross-fade (two-face) | `AnimatedContent` with `fadeIn(tween(250)) togetherWith fadeOut(tween(250))`. |
| Payment-received celebration | `AnimatedVisibility(enter = scaleIn(spring(0.5f, 0.7f)) + fadeIn, exit = fadeOut)` + 2.5s hold via `LaunchedEffect(Unit) { delay(2500); … }`. |
| Waiting-pulse | `rememberInfiniteTransition().animateFloat(... infiniteRepeatable(reverse))` on alpha. |

Honor `LocalAccessibilityManager.current` reduce-motion preference — skip non-essential animations.

### 10.8 Haptics

- Selection (tab change, filter change, sheet open): `HapticFeedbackType.TextHandleMove`.
- Success (receive completed): native success haptic (use `View.performHapticFeedback(HapticFeedbackConstants.CONFIRM)` via `LocalView.current`).
- Error (validation failed): `HapticFeedbackConstants.REJECT`.

### 10.9 Accessibility

- Every interactive composable has `Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = … }` or an explicit string parameter.
- Amounts announced as "Balance, 42000 satoshis" not "forty-two K".
- State conveyed by icon + color, never color alone (Pending = clock + orange).
- All text scales with system font size (no hardcoded sp outside theme).
- `Modifier.minimumInteractiveComponentSize()` on small touch targets (already default on `IconButton`).

### 10.10 Notifications (in-app event flow)

These pre-existing NotificationCenter events on iOS map to Kotlin `SharedFlow` or `StateFlow` on the existing managers:

| Event | Producer | Consumers |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Token received | `WalletManager.receiveTokens` → emit on `notifications` flow | Home toast, CashuRequestDetail celebration. |
| Transactions updated | `WalletManager.state.transactions` change | History list, Home recent. |
| Cashu Requests updated | `CashuRequestStore` flow | History list. |

## 11. Surface inventory (mapping anchor)

| iOS surface | Android screen / route | Notes |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Onboarding | `OnboardingScreen` (multi-step) | No bottom nav. |
| Tab: Wallet (`MainWalletView`) | `home/HomeScreen` | 4-tab `WalletScaffold` host. |
| Tab: History (`HistoryView`) | `history/HistoryScreen` | `CenterAlignedTopAppBar` (see §4 carve-out). |
| Tab: Mints (`MintsListView`) | `mints/MintsScreen` | Inline add form + Discover. |
| Tab: Settings (`SettingsView`) | `settings/SettingsScreen` | Group list. |
| Mint Detail | `mints/MintDetailScreen` (pushed) | |
| Mint Discovery (sheet) | `mints/MintDiscoveryScreen` (pushed) | Search list → pushed route, not sheet. |
| Settings sub-screens | `settings/{Backup,Lightning,P2PK,Nostr,NWC,Privacy,Appearance}Screen` (pushed) | |
| Send chooser (sheet from Home) | `home/sheets/SendChooserSheet` (ModalBottomSheet) | Cascade in. |
| Receive chooser (sheet from Home) | `home/sheets/ReceiveChooserSheet` | Cascade in. |
| Send (unified, `.large` sheet) | `send/UnifiedSendScreen` (flow sheet, full height) | Multi-step faces; hosted by `WalletFlowSheetHost`. |
| Send Ecash (full sheet) | `send/SendEcashScreen` (flow sheet, full height) | Two-face cross-fade; swaps in-sheet from Send. |
| Contactless | `Views/Send/ContactlessPayView` (shell overlay) | |
| Receive Ecash (medium/large sheet) | `receive/ReceiveEcashScreen` (flow sheet, wrap-content) | Two-face. |
| Receive Lightning (full sheet) | `receive/ReceiveLightningScreen` (flow sheet, full height) | Two-face. |
| Cashu Request Detail (sheet/push) | `receive/CashuRequestDetailScreen` (pushed) | |
| Transaction Detail (sheet) | `history/TransactionDetailScreen` (pushed) | |
| Receive Token Detail (full-screen cover) | `receive/ReceiveTokenDetailScreen` (pushed) | Deep-link entry. |
| Scanner (full-screen cover) | `home/ScannerScreen` (pushed) | |

## 12. Verification checklist (per screen)

When rebuilding any screen, confirm it:

1. Matches the iOS counterpart's **information density** (no missing data; no extra surface area).
2. Offers the **same actions in roughly the same place** (top-right ≈ `TopAppBar` actions; primary footer ≈ bottom-pinned button).
3. Routes to and from the **same neighboring screens** (Home → Send/Receive choosers → flow screens → back to Home; History row → Detail → back).
4. Handles **empty / loading / error / offline / no-mint-configured** states.
5. Respects light **and** dark themes.
6. Renders correctly at default and AX5 system font scales.
7. Works on minSdk (API 26 / Android 8) and current target (API 36 / Android 14+).

Run on both a Pixel 6+ emulator and a Pixel 4 / API 26 emulator before declaring a screen done.
